# Indonesian LocalX Machine Translation using NusaX
Indonesia have more than 17,000 islands, 360 ethnic groups, and 840 regional languages, Indonesia faces unique challenges in communication and socialization between its people. Moreover, without using it, our language can potentially become extinct.
This project aims to bridge this communication gap and increase the frequency of local language usage by creating a translation engine that can facilitate daily interactions.
So in this notebook we gonna train T5 model using all available languages in dataset NusaX
